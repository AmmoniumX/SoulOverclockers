# What is SoulOverclockers?
SoulOverclockers adds a single block to the game: the **Overclocker**. This block works like the Time In a Bottle or ProjectE's Watch Of Flowing Time, it accelerates machine-like blocks placed directly above it. The overclocker can be sped up or down using a **Soul Attuner**

# What makes it special?
The overclocker doesn't just require Forge Energy to operate, it also requires a new type of Energy called **Soul Power**. Soul Power is bound to the Player that places the Overclocker, and every overclocker placed on the world drains some soul power out of them. 
You can only have as many active Overclockers as your Soul Power can afford. To increase your Soul Power, you can equip certain **curios** that will give you additional soul power capacity.

# Customizability and Server-friendliness
SoulOverclockers is fully customizable and can be configured to be very server-friendly. Everything from players' base soul power, Forge Energy consumption, and maximum overclock speed can be specified on the configs. 
Additionally, server admins/modpack developers can even add their own custom **Soul Gear**, as long as a **curio** has an NBT such as {"SoulPower":10}, equipping it on their curio slots will give the player additional soul power capacity.
